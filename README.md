# LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! This repository contains solutions to LeetCode problems arranged in the order they appear on LeetCode.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized to mirror the order of problems on LeetCode:

```
LeetCode-Solutions/
│
├── Problem1/
│   ├── solution.py
│   └── README.md
│
├── Problem2/
│   ├── solution.java
│   └── README.md
│
└── ProblemN/
    ├── solution.cpp
    └── README.md
```

Each folder corresponds to a problem, and contains one or more solution files in different programming languages.
